## Database Schema (ERD)

## Architecture Highlights

This project showcases some interesting architectural patterns:

### Generic Email Module

I've implemented a flexible email system using the **Factory Pattern** that allows switching between different email providers (Brevo, SendGrid, Mailtrap) based on the environment:

- **Development**: Mailtrap (for testing)
- **Staging**: SendGrid
- **Production**: Brevo

  The beauty of this approach is that you can easily add new email providers without changing existing code - just implement the [`EmailProvider`](src/email/interfaces/email-provider.interface.ts) interface!

### Configurable Upload Module

Similarly, the upload module is built to be provider-agnostic. Currently configured for Cloudinary, but designed to easily support other storage solutions like AWS S3, Firebase, or local storage through the same factory pattern approach.

## Getting Started

You have two options to run this project: **Docker** (recommended) or **Local Development**.

### Option 1: Docker Setup (Recommended) üê≥

This is the easiest way to get up and running quickly!

#### Prerequisites

- Docker
- Docker Compose

#### Quick Start

1. **Clone the repository**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/MohamedAboElnaser/Blog-apis.git
cd Blog-apis
```

2. **Environment Setup**

```bash
# Copy the example environment file
cp .env.example .env

# Edit the .env file with your configurations
nano .env  # or use your preferred editor
```

3. **Run with Docker Compose**

```bash
# For development (with hot reload)
docker compose up --build

# For production
docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml up --build -d
```

4. **Seed the database (optional)**

```bash
# Access the running container
docker compose exec app npm run seed

# Or force seed (clears existing data)
docker compose exec app npm run seed:force
```

That's it! Your API will be available at `http://localhost:3000` 

### Option 2: Local Development Setup üíª

#### Prerequisites

- Node.js (>=18)
- MySQL database
- npm or yarn

#### Installation Steps

1. **Clone the repository**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/MohamedAboElnaser/Blog-apis.git
cd Blog-apis
```

2. **Install dependencies**

```bash
npm install
```

3. **Environment Setup**

```bash
# Copy the example environment file
cp .env.example .env

# Edit the .env file with your configurations
nano .env  # or use your preferred editor
```

4. **Database Setup**

   Make sure your MySQL database is running and create the database specified in your .env file.

5. **Run the application**

```bash
# Development mode
npm run start:dev

# Production mode
npm run build
npm run start:prod
```

6. **Seed the database (optional)**

```bash
# Regular seeding (skips if data exists)
npm run seed

# Force seeding (clears existing data)
npm run seed:force
```

### Environment Configuration

Create a .env file based on [.env.example](./.env.example) and fill in your specific configurations. This file contains sensitive information like database credentials, JWT secrets, and email provider settings.

## API Documentation

Once the application is running, you can access the API documentation in multiple ways:

### Interactive Documentation (Local)
Visit `http://localhost:3000/api` to access the interactive Swagger documentation when running the application locally. Here you'll find detailed information about all endpoints, request/response schemas, and can even test the API directly from the browser!

### Static Documentation (GitHub Pages)
üìö **[View Static API Documentation](https://MohamedAboElnaser.github.io/blog-api/)** - Always up-to-date documentation deployed automatically with each release.

> **Note**: The GitHub Pages documentation is static and doesn't allow testing endpoints directly. For interactive testing, use the local documentation or tools like Postman or Insomnia.

## Authentication & Security

### JWT Token Management

The API uses a dual-token authentication system for enhanced security:

- **Access Token**: Short-lived JWT token (15-30 minutes) sent in response body

  - Used for authenticating API requests
  - Include in Authorization header: `Bearer <access_token>`
  - Expires quickly for security

- **Refresh Token**: Long-lived token (7 days default) stored in HTTP-only cookie
  - Used to obtain new access tokens when they expire
  - Automatically sent with requests (HTTP-only cookie)
  - Cannot be accessed by JavaScript (XSS protection)

### Security Features

- **HTTP-Only Cookies**: Refresh tokens stored securely, inaccessible to client-side scripts
- **Environment-Based Security**: HTTPS-only cookies in production
- **Configurable Expiration**: Token lifetimes configurable via environment variables
- **Automatic Token Refresh**: Seamless token renewal without user intervention

**Usage Example:**

1. Login ‚Üí Receive access token + refresh token cookie
2. Use access token for API calls
3. When access token expires ‚Üí Call `/auth/refresh-token`
4. Receive new access token (refresh token cookie updated automatically)

## Database Seeding

The project includes a comprehensive seeding system that creates:

- **Test users** with verified accounts
- **Sample blog posts** (public and private)
- **Comments** on public blogs
- **Follow relationships** between users
- **Likes** on blog posts

This makes it super easy to get started with development - just run the seed command and you'll have a fully populated database to work with!

### Seeded User Credentials

**‚ö†Ô∏è Important**: To use the seeded data, make sure your `.env` file has the following SALT value:

```
SALT='$2b$10$CfyyfGZKr/OjMf6wJ34Na.'
```

All seeded users use the password: **`pass1234`**

**Available Test Users:**

- `admin@blog.com` (Admin User)
- `john.doe@example.com` (John Doe)
- `jane.smith@example.com` (Jane Smith)
- `mike.wilson@example.com` (Mike Wilson)
- `sarah.jones@example.com` (Sarah Jones)

You can login with any of these emails using the password `pass1234` to test the application functionality immediately!
